## Why Mostly.Vet?

The core problem facing hell let loose is community retention and new member training. Fostering and maintaining the culture to continue with high turn over is a non-trivial task. Much like a real military expanding aggressively the problems faced by our community is very real, but can be solved by encouraging a strong experienced player core to remain in the community and teach new players by demonstration. Mostly.Vet anticipates by having servers with 60-80% Veteran players we will be able to maintain NCO engagement and provide an environment for new players to learn by example and practice amongst an experienced player core.

## Why is this different than previous attempts at veteran servers? 
Automation! No manual validation process is needed, the servers will organically adjust to interest of players.

## Is this bad for blueberries?
Not at all, in fact its quite good! Being able to play amongst many experienced players gives more opportunities to learn, build culture, and ask questions.

## Servers 
Currently we have a dedicated server [https://www.battlemetrics.com/servers/search?q=mostly.vet&game=hll&sort=score servers] located in US-West.
