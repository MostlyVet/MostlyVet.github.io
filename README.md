## Why Mostly.Vet?
The core problem facing hell let loose is community retention and new member training. Fostering and maintaining the culture to continue with high turn over is a non-trivial task. Much like a real military expanding aggressively the problems faced by our community is very real, but can be solved by encouraging a strong experienced player core to remain in the community and teach new players by demonstration. Mostly.Vet anticipates by having servers with 60-80% Veteran players we will be able to maintain NCO engagement and provide an environment for new players to learn by example and practice amongst an experienced player core.
